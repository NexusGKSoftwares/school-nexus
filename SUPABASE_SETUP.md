# Supabase Backend Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for setting up the Supabase backend for the School Nexus application, including database schema, authentication, and complete data migration from demo data to real Supabase data.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Note your project URL and anon key
3. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

### 2. Run Database Migrations

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g supabase

# Link your project
supabase link --project-ref your_project_ref

# Run migrations
supabase db push
```

### 3. Set Up Authentication

1. Go to Authentication > Settings in your Supabase dashboard
2. Configure your site URL and redirect URLs
3. Enable email confirmations if needed

### 4. Create Admin Users

```sql
-- Insert admin user (replace with your email)
INSERT INTO auth.users (
  email,
  encrypted_password,
  email_confirmed_at,
  created_at,
  updated_at,
  role
) VALUES (
  'admin@university.edu',
  crypt('admin123', gen_salt('bf')),
  now(),
  now(),
  now(),
  'admin'
);

-- Insert admin profile
INSERT INTO profiles (
  id,
  first_name,
  last_name,
  email,
  role,
  status
) VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'admin@university.edu'),
  'Admin',
  'User',
  'admin@university.edu',
  'admin',
  'active'
);
```

## üîê Row Level Security (RLS)

### Authentication Policies

```sql
-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE courses ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ... (repeat for all tables)

-- Profiles: Users can only see their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Courses: Lecturers see their courses, students see enrolled courses
CREATE POLICY "Lecturers can view their courses" ON courses
  FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT id FROM lecturers WHERE id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Students can view courses they're enrolled in
CREATE POLICY "Students can view enrolled courses" ON courses
  FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT student_id FROM enrollments WHERE course_id = courses.id
    )
  );
```
